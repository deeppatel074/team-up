# TEAM UP

# To Start on localhost

To start the server simply follow following steps:

- npm install
- npm start

To start the client simply follow following steps:

- npm install
- npm start

# To Start on Docker

- Download docker on your machine and install the setup.
- Open the docker application you will see your docker is running
- Now go to the project directory on your cmd where docker-compose.yml file is present
- Run "docker-compose build --no-cache"
- Then "docker-compose up"
- Once docker is both client and server get stated.

# To connect mongo atlas collection

- Go to .env file you will find mongoSrv there copy that and past it on to Compass in new connection then connect

## Project Description:

In this project, we are going to develop an all-in-one workspace management application that will be able to perform the following functions:

1. Invite users to the workspace to create tasks. Users can create a task. The users can also set deadlines for the tasks. Whenever a task is created or updated, all their team members would be notified via email. The team can thus work on these tasks and accomplish their target. Once the entire task is completed, the user who created the task gets notified via email.
2. There will be another feature for the users to upload documents of any format which can be accessed by the team members present within that task.
3. Finally, there would be a feature of a meeting schedule where the users can schedule a meeting. As soon as the meeting is scheduled, all members present in that task would be notified via email.
   Thus, all in all, we are creating a perfect workspace that would help the clients easily segregate their tasks and complete their targets before the deadline.

## Course Technologies:

### React

User interfaces and UI components are built using the frontend library React. It will be utilized to develop a single-page application and reusable UI elements for our pages.

### Firebase

A framework for creating safe authentication systems while enhancing the sign-in process is called Firebase authentication. We'll utilize Firebase to authenticate users for our app and support sign-in across several platforms.

### Redis

Redis is a highly efficient read-and-write in-memory NoSQL key/value store and caching technology. Redis will be used for data caching so that our application may make fewer API calls and respond to requests more quickly.

## Independent Technologies:

### Docker

Docker is utilized throughout the development lifecycle for quick, simple, and portable application development - desktop and cloud. It eliminates tedious, recurring configuration procedures. UIs, CLIs, APIs, and security are all included in Docker's full end-to-end platform, which is designed to cooperate throughout the whole application delivery lifecycle.

### AWS

Cloud computing services from Amazon Web Services are dependable, scalable, and reasonably priced. Free to join; just pay for services used.
